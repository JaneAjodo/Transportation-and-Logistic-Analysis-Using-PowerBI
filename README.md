# 🚚 Transportation & Logistic Analysis (Power BI)

This project presents a detailed analysis of transportation and logistics operations using Power BI. The dashboard uncovers bottlenecks, shipment delays, supplier inefficiencies, and material movement patterns to support data-driven decisions.

## 📌 Overview

- **Total Shipments:** 3,585  
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** 38.52%  
- **Delay Frequency:** 61%  
- **Average Delivery Time:** 422.71 hours  
- **Average Delay Time:** 285.85 hours  

This analysis highlights significant improvement areas across logistics and transportation functions.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Handled missing values  
- Standardized and split date/time formats  
- Trimmed extra whitespace  
- Created new calculated columns:  
  - `Distance` between origin and destination  
  - `Delivery Time`  
  - `Delay Status`

## 📐 DAX Measures

- Average Delivery Time  
- Average Delay Time  
- Delay Frequency  
- Total Shipments by Customer, Supplier, and Material  
- On-Time Rate


## 📊 Dashboard Insights

- Delay patterns by **routes**, **suppliers**, and **materials**  
- Shipment peak periods by **month/quarter**  
- Geo-map of delays by origin location  
- Supplier performance and efficiency  
- Shipment delivery status by day of week


## 🎯 Recommendations

- Optimize routes with high delivery times  
- Reassess suppliers with poor delivery records (e.g., Ekta Transport)  
- Focus on materials frequently involved in delays  
- Align staffing and logistics around peak shipment times  


## 🛠 Tools Used

- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Excel  
- Data Modeling  
- Geospatial Mapping
